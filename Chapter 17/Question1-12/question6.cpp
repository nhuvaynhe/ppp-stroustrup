    This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory 
    using new. Thatâ€™s called memory exhaustion. Find out what happens. You have 
    two obvious alternatives: look for documentation, or write a program with 
    an  infinite  loop that  allocates  but  never deallocates. Try both. Approxi-
    mately how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing?

        cout << i << '\t' << ";\t" << *num << endl;
